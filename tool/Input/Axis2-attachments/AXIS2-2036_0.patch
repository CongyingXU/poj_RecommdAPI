-<h2>Mail Guideline</h2>
-<p>Every volunteer project obtains its strength from the people involved in it. 
-Mailing lists provide a simple and effective communication mechanism. </p>
-<p>You are welcome to join any of our mailing lists (or all of them if you 
-wish). You can choose to lurk, or actively participate. It's up to you.</p>
-<p><b>Before you join these lists, you should make sure that you read and follow 
-the information below... </b></p>
-<p>We ask that you do your best to respect the charter of the appropriate 
-mailing list. There are generally two types of lists that you can join. </p>
-<ul>
-	<li>The &quot;User&quot; list is where you should send questions and comments about 
-	configuration, setup, usage and other &quot;user&quot; types of questions.</li>
-	<li>The &quot;Developer&quot; list is where you should should send questions and 
-	comments about the actual software source code and general &quot;development&quot; 
-	types of questions. </li>
-</ul>
-<p><b>Summary : Prefix each message with &quot;[Axis2]&quot;</b> <br>
-You may already know that Axis 1.x is still going parallel with Axis 2.0. So for 
-everyone's convenience prefix the subject of <b>every mail </b>about Axis 2.0 
-with [Axis2].</p>
-<p><b>Summary: Join the lists that are appropriate for your discussion.</b> <br>
-Please make sure that you are joining the list that is appropriate for the topic 
-or product that you would like to discuss.</p>
-<p><b>Summary: Do not abuse resources in order to get help.</b> <br>
-Asking your configuration or user type of question on the developers list 
-because you think that you will get help more quickly by going directly to the 
-developers instead of to the user base is not very nice. Chances are that doing 
-this will actually prevent people from answering your question because it is 
-clear that you are trying to abuse resources.</p>
-<p><b>Summary: Do your best to ensure that you are not sending HTML or &quot;Stylelized&quot; 
-email to the list.</b> <br>
-If you are using Outlook or Outlook Express or Eudora, chances are that you are 
-sending HTML email by default. There is usually a setting that will allow you to 
-send &quot;Plain Text&quot; email. If you are using Microsoft products to send email, 
-there are several bugs in the software that prevent you from turning off the 
-sending of HTML email. Please read this page as well...</p>
-<p><b>Summary: Watch where you are sending email.</b> <br>
-The majority of our mailing lists have set the Reply-To to go back to the list. 
-That means that when you Reply to a message, it will go to the list and not to 
-the original author directly. The reason is because it helps facilitate 
-discussion on the list for everyone to benefit from. Be careful of this as 
-sometimes you may intend to reply to a message directly to someone instead of 
-the entire list.</p>
-<p><b>Summary: Do not crosspost messages.</b> <br>
-In other words, pick a mailing list and send your messages to that mailing list 
-only. Do not send your messages to multiple mailing lists. The reason is that 
-people may be subscribed to one list and not to the other. Therefore, some 
-people may only see half of the conversation. </p>
