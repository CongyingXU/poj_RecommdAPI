-<body>
-<h2>Welcome to Apache Axis2</h2>
-
-<p>Apache Axis2 is an implementation of the <a
-href="http://www.w3.org/TR/soap/">Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)
-Recommendation</a> from the <a href="http://www.w3.org">W3C</a>.  Axis2 can
-be used to provide and consume Web Services.</p>
-
-<p>From the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/soap/">W3C recommendation</a>:</p>
-
-<div style="padding-left: 20px; padding-top: 5px; font-style:italic;">
-"SOAP is a lightweight protocol for exchange of information in a
-decentralized, distributed environment. It is an XML based protocol that
-consists of three parts: an envelope that defines a framework for describing
-what is in a message and how to process it, a set of encoding rules for
-expressing instances of application-defined datatypes, and a convention for
-representing remote procedure calls and responses."</div>
-
-<p>Apache Axis2 is an effort to re-implement both Axis/Java and Axis/C++ on a
-new architecture.  Building upon the "handler chain" model developed in
-Axis1, Axis2 introduces a more flexible pipeline architecture which lends
-itself to greater modularity and extensibility.  This extensibility will
-allow Axis2 to act as a foundation for a growing constellation of associated
-Web Services protocols including:</p>

-<h2>Axis2 Background and Motivation</h2>
-
-<p>Axis1 was built under the assumption that other protocols such as
-WS-ReliableMessaging would be integrated into Axis1's handler chain.  Axis1
-had the concept of a MessageContext and a chain of transport, service, and
-global message handlers, but Axis1 lacked a clear extension architecture to
-enable clean composition of such layers. One of the key motivations for Axis2
-is to provide a clean and simple environment for implementations of
-associated WS standards such as <a
-href="http://ws.apache.org/sandesha/">Apache Sandesha</a> and <a
-href="http://ws.apache.org/wss4j/">Apache WSS4J</a>.  Implementations of
-associated standards should be able to easily interface with the base SOAP
-Message handling system.   In summary, Axis2 has a more modular and flexible
-message handling pipeline, it focuses on the details of message handling and
-provides clear hooks for implementations of associated Web Services standards
-and protocols.  This evolution will allow Axis to be a foundational
-technology for next generation Web Services.</p>
-
-<p>Axis2 introduces a representation for SOAP messages called <b>AXIOM (AXIs
-Object Model)</b>. AXIOM consists of two parts: a complete XML Infoset
-representation and a SOAP Infoset representation. The XML Infoset
-representation provides a JDOM-esque API built atop a deferred model via a
-StAX-based (Streaming API for XML) pull parsing API. A key feature of AXIOM
-is that it allows one to stop building the XML tree and just access the pull
-stream directly; thus enabling both maximum flexibility and maximum
-performance. This approach allows Axis2 to support multiple levels of
-abstraction for consuming and offering Web services: using plain AXIOM, using
-generated code and statically data-bound data types and so on.  Developers
-with demanding performance requirements will be able to use AXIOM to create
-highly scaleable Web Services.</p>
-
-<p>A third shift in Axis 2 is the de-emphasis of RPC-oriented Web Services
-and a shift towards more document-oriented, message style asynchronous
-service interactions.  With Axis2, clients can interact with servers in a
-number of ways, and the client API provides both a blocking and non-blocking
-API.  At the time of Axis1's design, RPC-style, synchronous, request-response
-interactions were the order of the day for Web services. Today service
-interactions are much more message-oriented and exploit many different
-message exchange patterns. The Axis2 engine architecture is careful to not
-build in any assumptions of request-response patterns to ensure that it can
-be used easily to support arbitrary message exchange patterns. Don't
-worry,you'll still be able to use Axis2 like you used Axis1, you'll just have
-a richer set of options for client-server interaction.</p>
