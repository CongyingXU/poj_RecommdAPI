Hello, this repository contains experimental data and related tools for the work “MULAPI: Improving API method recommendation with API usage location”.    


Experiment_data:
	- para_trainingResult0.txt: the parameters for feature location
	- para_trainingResult1.txt: the parameters forAPI recommendation
	- API_Usage_Location_experiment_result: the result of API usage location recommendation 
	- API_recommendation_experiments_result: the result of API methods recommendation 

Tools:
	-MULAPI: the tool with user-friendly interface, work as a web service.
	-tool_mac: just experimental platform for mac 
	-tool_win: just experimental platform for win
	—AmaLgam_plus: Wang et al.’s work, we re-run it for comparative experiment to evaluate the effect of MULAPI in recommending API usage location.
	
 
Best wishes
