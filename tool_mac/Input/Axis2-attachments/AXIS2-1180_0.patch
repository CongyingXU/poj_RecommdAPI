-
-<h2>Introduction</h2>
-
-<p>The Axis2 code generator comes built-in with an <a
-href="http://www.eclipse.org">eclipse</a> plug-in. This plug-in can be used
-to generate a WSDL file from a java class (Java2WSDL) and/or a java class
-file from a WSDL (WSDL2Java). First you need to install the plug-in. The
-instruction for installation are given below.</p>
-<a name="installation"></a>
-
-<h2>Installation</h2>
-
-<p>The easiest way to obtain the plug-in would be the binary distribution.
-The packages plug-in would be available from the tools section of the
-downloads page</p>
-
-<p>If one needs to build the plugin from source it is not as trivial as
-running the Maven build. The reason is that the plug-in depends heavily on
-the Eclipse classes, which are only available in an Eclipse environment. The
-recommended procedure is to run the create-project.xml (in the "modules\tool"
-directory of the source distribution) build file which will create two
-folders (the other one for the Service Archiver tool) and copy the necessary
-files to relevant folders. Then Eclipse should be configured to open the
-contents in a PDE project. Please go through the Eclipse documentation to
-learn how to open projects in the PDE format.</p>
-
-<p>Once you've obtained the plug-in just unzip the content of the plug-in
-archive to the eclipse plug-in directory (if it is the zipped-binary version)
-or copy the necessary folders to the eclipse plug-in directory and restart
-Eclipse.</p>
-
-<p><strong>Note</strong> - This plug-in works on Eclipse version 3.1 and
-upwards. The provided screen shots may slightly differ with what the user
-would actually see but the functionality has not been changed.</p>
-<a name="operation1"></a>
-
-<h2>Operation - WSDL2Java</h2>
-
-<p>If the plug-in is properly installed you should see a new wizard under the
-"New" section.(use the File -&gt; New -&gt; Other or Ctrl + N )</p>
-
-<p><img border="0" src="images/wsdl2java-screen0.jpg"></p>
-
-<p>Selecting the wizard and pressing the Next button will start the code
-generator wizard. Following is the first wizard page.</p>
-
-<p><strong>Page 1:</strong></p>
-
-<p><img src="images/wsdl2java-screen1.jpg"></p>
-
-<p>Selecting the 'Generate Java source code from WSDL file' option and
-clicking Next leads to the following page.</p>
-
-<p><strong>WSDL2Java Page 2 :</strong></p>
-
-<p><img border="0" src="images/wsdl2java-screen2.jpg"></p>
-
-<p>To move on to the next page the WSDL file location must be given. The
-Browse button can be used to easily browse for a file rather than typing the
-whole path.</p>
-
-<p><strong>WSDL2Java Page 3 :</strong></p>
-
-<p>Once the WSDL file is selected, the next page will take you to the page
-from where <strong>codegen options</strong> are to be selected. By far this
-is the most important page in this wizard. This page determines the
-characteristics of the code being generated.</p>
-
-<p>Novices need not worry about these options since the most common options
-are defaulted, but advanced users will find it very easy to "turn the knobs"
-using these options.</p>
-
-<p><img border="0" src="images/wsdl2java-screen3.jpg"></p>
-
-<p>Once the options are selected, only the final step of the code generation
-is left which is the selection of the output file location.</p>
-
-<p><strong>WSDL2Java Page 4 :</strong></p>
-
-<p>Here you can select the output file path by typing or browsing using the
-Browse button. You have the option of browsing only workspace projects by
-selecting the 'Browse Workspace projects only' 'checkbox.</p>
-
-<p><img border="0" src="images/wsdl2java-screen4.jpg"></p>
-
-<p>When the output file location is selected, the Finish button will be
-enabled. Clicking the Finish button will generate the code and a message box
-will pop up acknowledging the success. Well Done! You've successfully
-completed Axis2 code generation.</p>
-<a name="operation2"></a>
-
-<h2>Operation - Java2WSDL</h2>
-
-<p><strong>Page 1:</strong></p>
-
-<p>For this operation you need to select the option which says 'Generate a
-WSDL from a Java source file'</p>
-
-<p><img border="0" src="images/java2wsdl-screen0.jpg"></p>
-
-<p>Then click the Next button which will lead to the next page below.</p>
-
-<p><strong>Java2WSDL Page 2:</strong></p>
-
-<p><img border="0" src="images/java2wsdl-screen1.jpg"></p>
-
-<p>In this page one needs to select the class to be exposed and the relevant
-jar files /classes to be loaded as the classpath. After the libraries have
-been set, the 'Test Class Loading' button must be clicked in order to test
-whether the class is loadable. Unless the class loading is successful
-proceeding to the Next button will not be enabled.</p>
-
-<p>Once the classloading is successful and Next button is clicked the page
-below will appear.</p>
-
-<p><strong>Java2WSDL Page 3:</strong></p>
-
-<p>This page allows the parameters to be modified by setting the options for
-the generator.</p>
-
-<p><img border="0" src="images/java2wsdl-screen2.jpg"></p>
-
-<p><strong>Java2WSDL Page 4:</strong></p>
-
-<p>Output file location can be browsed using the Browse button. Note that by
-selecting 'browse Workspace projects only' check box you can browse for
-workspace projects only. Once output file location and output WSDL file name
-is add you can click the Finish button to complete generation.</p>
-
-<p><img border="0" src="images/java2wsdl-screen3.jpg"></p>
-
-<p>If a message box pops up acknowledging the success, then you've
-successfully completed the Java2WSDL code generation. </p>
