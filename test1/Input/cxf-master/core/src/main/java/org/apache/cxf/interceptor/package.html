Core interceptor interfaces which form the basis for message processing chains
in CXF.  Interceptors are grouped into ordered lists called an interceptor
chains.  There is both an outbound and an inbound interceptor chain for both 
a CXF-based SOAP client, and a CXF-based web service.  Additionally, in 
the case of SOAPFaults, a CXF web service will create a separate outbound 
error handling chain and the client an inbound one.
