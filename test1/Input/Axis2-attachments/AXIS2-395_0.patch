+<h2>What is Web Services (WS) Policy?</h2>
+
+<p>To consume non trivial web services one must fully understand its xml
+contract (WSDL) along with any other additional requirements, capabilities or
+preferences which translates to the configuration of the service, and
+essentially becomes the policies of the service.</p>
+
+<p>WS Policy framework provides a way to express the policies of a service in
+a machine-readable way. Web services infrastructure can be enhanced to
+understand and enforce policies at runtime. For instance, a service author
+might write a policy requiring digital signature and encryption, while
+service consumers could use the policy information to reason out whether they
+can adhere to this policy information to use the service or not.</p>
+
+<p>Further more, web service infrastructure could be enhanced to enforce
+those requirements without requiring the service author to write even single
+line of code.</p>
+
+<h2>What's in this release?</h2>
+
+<p>In this current release Axis2 framework uses ws-commons/policy as an
+object model to manipulate policy documents. All its description builders
+store any policy information included in description documents (services.xml,
+axis2.xml, .. etc) in the appropriate description classes. This information
+is available at both deployment and run time via these description
+classes.</p>
+
+<p>When generating WSDL dynamically for each service, policy information in
+the description classes is included. For instance, if you declare a policy in
+axis2.xml then that policy is reflected in service elements of WSDL of every
+service. If a policy is declared in a services.xml, it is shown in the
+service element of WSDL for that particular service.</p>
+
+<p>Next step is to use that information to engage and configure required
+modules and allow the module to make use of this policy information.</p>
+
+<p>It is evident that a great deal of work is required to make axis2 a fully
+fledged ws-policy supported web service infrastructure. But it is encouraging
+to note that we've taken the first steps towards this goal. We appreciate any
+suggestions, patches etc you send us in this regard. Keep on
+contributing...!</p>
