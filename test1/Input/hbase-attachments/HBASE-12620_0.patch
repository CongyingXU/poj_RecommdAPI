+          <para> As mentioned in the above sections, the interface <code>VisibilityLabelService</code> could
+            be used to implement the way the visibility expressions can be stored in the cells. When we have clusters
+            with replication we also require that the visibility expressions are also replicated to the peer cluster.
+            Take the case where the <code>DefaultVisibilityLabelServiceImpl</code> is used as the implementation for
+            <code>VisibilityLabelService</code>. All the visibility expression are converted to the corresponding
+            ordinal based expression based on the ordinals for each visibility label stored in the labels table. This 
+            would mean that during replication the cells with visibility would also be replicated with ordinal based 
+            expression.  In the peer cluster, we may not have the same labels table with the same ordinal mapping for 
+            the visibility labels. In that case the ordinals in the replicated cell does not make sense.
+            Hence it would be better if the replication happens with the visibility expression as strings.
+            In order to replicate the visibility expression as strings to the peer cluster we have a RegionServerObserver
+            configuration which would work based on the implementation of the interface <code>VisibilityLabelService</code>.
+            Use the below configuration to configure replication of visibility expressions to peer cluster as strings. See
