            This is a simplified version of the schema for http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace
            located at http://www.w3.org/2001/xml.xsd. It is actually closer to the original
            (but outdated) schema located at http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace.xsd.
            In particular, it avoids usage of a union to represent the "lang" attribute.
