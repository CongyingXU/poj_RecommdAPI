/**
 * The message-destination-linkType is used to link a message destination reference or
 * message-driven bean to a message destination.
 * <p/>
 * The Assembler sets the value to reflect the flow of messages between producers and consumers in
 * the application.
 * <p/>
 * The value must be the message-destination-name of a message destination in the same Deployment
 * File or in another Deployment File in the same Java EE application unit.
 * <p/>
 * Alternatively, the value may be composed of a path name specifying a Deployment File containing
 * the referenced message destination with the message-destination-name of the destination appended
 * and separated from the path name by "#". The path name is relative to the Deployment File
 * containing Deployment Component that is referencing the message destination.  This allows
 * multiple message destinations with the same name to be uniquely identified.
 * <p/>
