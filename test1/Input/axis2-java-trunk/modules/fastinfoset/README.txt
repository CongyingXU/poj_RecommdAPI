This module handles Fast Infoset (FI) binary serialization for Axis2.

The fast infoset parser used here is from Fast Infoset Project @ https://fi.dev.java.net/

FI 1.1.x is targeted to JDK1.4 and is used in JAX-WS 2.0, JAXB 2.0.
FI 1.2.x is targeted to JDK1.5 and is used in JAX-WS 2.1, JAXB 2.1.

The maven script automatically detects the JDK version and use the appropriate FI jar file.
