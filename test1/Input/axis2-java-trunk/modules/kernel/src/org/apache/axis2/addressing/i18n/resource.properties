# Translation instructions.
# 1.  Each message line is of the form key=value.
#     Translate the value, DO NOT translate the key.
# 2.  The messages may contain arguments that will be filled in
#     by the runtime.  These are of the form: {0}, {1}, etc.
#     These must appear as is in the message, though the order
#     may be changed to support proper language syntax.
# 3.  If a single quote character is to appear in the resulting
#     message, it must appear in this file as two consecutive
#     single quote characters.
# 4.  Lines beginning with "#" (like this one) are comment lines
#     and may contain translation instructions.  They need not be
#     translated unless your translated file, rather than this file,
#     will serve as a base for other translators.

outboundNoAction=Unable to determine wsa:Action for outbound message

specificInvalidAddressingHeader=The server failed to process the WS-Addressing header: {0} [Reason]: A header representing a Message Addressing Property is not valid and the message cannot be processed
invalidAddressingHeader=The server failed to process one of the WS-Addressing headers. [Reason]: A header representing a Message Addressing Property is not valid and the message cannot be processed
specificInvalidCardinality=The server received more than one {0} WS-Addressing header
invalidCardinality==The server received more copies of a WS-Addressing header than expected
specificMissingAddressInEPR=A {0} header was expected to be an EPR but did not contain an [address].
missingAddressInEPR=A WS-Addressing header was expected to be an EPR but did not contain an [address].
duplicateMessageID=The server rejected the message because it had a WS-Addressing MessageID which it had processed previously.
actionMismatch=WS-Addressing Fault: The SOAPAction and wsa:Action received by the server did not match.
specificOnlyAnonymousSupported=The {0} header contained a non-anonymous [address] which is not supported by the server.
onlyAnonymousSupported=A WS-Addressing header contained a non-anonymous [address] which is not supported by the server.

# Spec Fault Strings - DO NOT NLS without contacting developers for advice
spec.FAULT_ACTION_NOT_SUPPORTED_REASON=The [action] cannot be processed at the receiver.
spec.final.FAULT_INVALID_HEADER_REASON=A header representing a Message Addressing Property is not valid and the message cannot be processed
spec.final.FAULT_ADDRESSING_HEADER_REQUIRED_REASON=A required header representing a Message Addressing Property is not present
spec.final.FAULT_ADDRESSING_DESTINATION_UNREACHABLE_REASON=No route can be determined to reach [destination]
spec.submission.FAULT_ADDRESSING_DESTINATION_UNREACHABLE_REASON=No route can be determined to reach the destination role defined by the WS-Addressing To.
spec.submission.FAULT_INVALID_HEADER_REASON=A message information header is not valid and the message cannot be processed. The validity failure can be either structural or semantic, e.g. a [destination] that is not a URI or a [relationship] to a [message id] that was never issued.
spec.submission.FAULT_ADDRESSING_HEADER_REQUIRED_REASON=A required message information header, To, MessageID, or Action, is not present.
